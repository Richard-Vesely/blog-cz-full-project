Dear reader,  
I want to share with you an important realization I got today. Which is then often, when I get angry or upset I suppress the emotion so that I am not nasty to other people. But I don't want to suppress my emotions. I don't think it is healthy and for sure it is hindering me in my personal growth. However, when I focus on not suppressing the emotion I am nasty to other people. Which is something I don't want to do.  
So what do I do?  
**I want to learn how to feel angry (and feel it really intensely) while not being super nasty to other people.**  That would be cool and useful.
