Lately I have often felt a need to write about something that interests me while I was away from keyboard. However, when I sit down to write I feel a block. I am not sure why that is but I suspect that it has to do something not wanting to publish imperfect things. Or just being afraid I won't be able to formulate my thoughts. As if either of those points mattered. Hence I just want to try to publish 1000 words a day regardless of quality for a week.  

Why am I doing this?  
1. To see how it will make me feel. 
2. To understand whether I am not writing more (despite often feeling like I want to) because I am afraid or because I actually don't enjoy it.
3. To get more comfortable with putting online stuff that is probably useless to others just for my pleasure.
